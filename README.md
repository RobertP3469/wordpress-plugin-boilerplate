# WordPress Plugin Boilerplate
Bootstrap project for creating new WordPress plugins

# File and Folder Structure
The base software architecture of this plugin template uses the 3-tier Architecture advocated in the early years of ASP.NET. This is because I began doing web development when ASP.NET first came out in 2001, and old habits are hard to break. 

The folder structure is as follows:

                      main-plugin-folder
                        - bl (business logic layer)
                        - dl (data access layer)
                        - pl (presentation layer)
                          - css
                          - images
                          - js
